# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Yarn Installation

Make sure to have yarn installed on your system. If you don't, go to [Yarn Website](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/), pick your Operating system then download / install it.

To check if it is working, open up a terminal (cmd) and run `yarn --version`

## Dependencies Installation

In the project directory, you can run `yarn install`. This will install all of the necessary dependencies that the project needs.

## Start the app

In the project directory, run `yarn start`. It runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Framework & Styling

I used ReactJS since it enables me to build the project in a much more simple but organized way. I also used TypeScript instead of JavaScript to have a better type-checking on my variables. For the styling, I combined both bootstrap and MaterialUI. This enables me to create components in a perfect way.
